    <p><b>what is CSS?</b></p>
    <br></br>
    <div id="p1">
    1. CSS stands for Cascading Syle Sheets.
    <br></br>
    2.CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. 
    <br></br>
    3.<del>Css is not necessary </del><span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work</span>. it can control the layoyt of multiple web pages all at once. 
    </div>

    <div style="color: red;"> 4.<span id="p2"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. </span></div>
    </div>
    <br></br>
    <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <div id="p3">
        <ul>
       <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <br>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <br> 
        <li> external - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li> <br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span style="background-color: yellow;"> in this tutorial we will 
           &nbsp; use inline and internal styles ,becouse this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</span> </li><br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="p4">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style 
        to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        <br></br>
        In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set 
        of styles can be applied to the element.
        <br></br>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style 
        should applied.
